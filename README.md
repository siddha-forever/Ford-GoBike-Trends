# Ford-GoBike-Trends
This project involves data analysis on the San Francisco Bay Area bike-sharing dataset, uncovering insights on trip durations, seasonal trends, and user behaviour through cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis.

# Skills Learned: 
Data Cleaning, Data Analysis, Data Visualization.

# Technology: 
Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib.

# Data Source:

# Questions to be Answered:

1.	How long does the average trip take?
2.	Is the trip duration affected by weather (months/seasons)?
3.	Does the above depend on whether a user is a subscriber or customer?


# Summary of Findings: 
1. The trip duration has a close relationship with bike share company's revenue. It turns out that Weather does not have a big effect on the trip duration but user type does have an impact on trip duration.
2. According the analysis, it is found subscribers tend to rend the bikes for longer trips ( generally above 300 minutes ). One possible way to increase revenue is to attract more potential customers and convert more exiting customers to subscribers.
